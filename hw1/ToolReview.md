#Tool Reviews

In this document, eight different visualization tools are reviewed from my perspective. There are The visualization toolkit (VTK), Slicer, Matlab, Data-Driven Documents (D3), Tableau Public, Processing, WebGL, and OpenGL. The following criteria will be evaluated:

 * **Capability (C)**.
 * **Supported data type (SD)**. Supported data type includes Nominal (`N`), Ordered (`O`), Interval (`I`), and Ratio (`R`).
 * **Supported Visualization data type(SV)**. Examined `native` visualization data type includes points (`p`), lines (`l`), areas (`a`), volumes (`v`), and glyphs (`g`). If it's not provided by the native function the visualization tools provides, it will not count as supported.  
 * **API (A)**. Evaluate if API exist/GUI only, if it is script/programming language.
 * **Customization (Cu)**.
 
 The reviewed tools are listed in the following table. The result is based on surfing on its homepage and my own experience.
 
 | Tool\Metrics  | Capacity   | Data type  | Visualization data type  | API  | Customization |
 |---|---|---|---|---|---|
 | VTK  | 2D & 3D interactive graphics rendering, visualization and processing software system  | All  | All  | Script&programing   | `Expandable`  |
 | Slicer  | 2D & 3D Medical image visualization application  | All  |  All | GUI&programming&script  | `plugin`  |
 | Matlab  | 2D & 3D Fast prototyping & build-in functionality for visualization  | All  | All  | GUI&script&programming  | `Expandable` |
 | D3  | Decoupling framework & Data driven approach to DOM manipulation (3D needs other js) | All | All (no `v`)  | js  | `Expandable`  |
 | Tableau Public  | 2D Interactive task based visualization for business intelligence  |  All  | All (no `v`)   | GUI only | `Very Limited`  |
 | Processing  | 2d,3d graphics rendering & interactive Params | All | All (no `v`)  | GUI&script   | `Expandable`  |
 | WebGL  | js based interactive 2d,3d graphics rendering on websites  | All (no double)  | All (no `v`)  | js | `Expandable`  |
 | OpenGL  | c/c++ based interactive 2d,3d graphics rendering on clients  | All   | All  | c/c++  | `Expandable`  |
